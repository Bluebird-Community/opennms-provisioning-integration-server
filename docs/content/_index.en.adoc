== Welcome to the Provisioning Integration Server (PRIS) for link:https://www.opennms.org[OpenNMS]

Version is: **{{% version %}}**

If you have a large network and discovery doesn't help and you have one or multiple inventory, _PRIS_ can help you to use this sources as inventory for your _OpenNMS_.
The result of _PRIS_ is the OpenNMS requisition model which can be read from _OpenNMS Provisiond_.
It gives you several steps to integrate, enrich, transform, clean up and merge your extracted data before you start monitoring with _OpenNMS_.

The output from _PRIS_ is provided as _XML_ over _HTTP_ or just as a file ready to read from the _OpenNMS Provisioning_ system.

_PRIS_ can be downloaded from the link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-provisioning-integration-server/releases/latest[GitHub page] of the project. +

== Overview

The components from left to right are described as followed:

- **OpenNMS Provisiond**: This is the internal daemon responsible to get nodes (networked devices) into OpenNMS. Provisiond scans for SNMP information, network services and has to model the network monitoring behavior for OpenNMS.
- **Driver**: The driver is the method how to present the data from _PRIS_ to _OpenNMS_. It is only possible to configure _one_ driver per _PRIS_ instance
- **OpenNMS Requisition**: The data model which has to be built inside of _PRIS_. This is the shared model between _OpenNMS_ and _PRIS_.
- **Requisition configuration**: The description of the integration of your external datasource. A requisition configuration defines which source should be used or which scripts should be applied to modify or transform the data before they are provided into _OpenNMS Provisiond_.
- **Mapper Script**: The mapper script is the last script executed before the generated requisition goes to _OpenNMS Provisiond_ through the driver. You can use a mapper script to enrich the requisition, remove nodes or replace OpenNMS requistion node attributes.
- **Custom Scripts**: In some cases an external inventory has its own data model, e.g. OCS Inventory. The script source can be used to map the external inventory-specific model into the OpenNMS requisition model.
- **Source**: This is the specific implementation retrieving the data for from your external inventory.
- **External Inventory**: The inventory from which you want to import data for OpenNMS. It could be a free application like phpIPAM, idoIT, ITIL ticket system like OTRS, a simple spreadsheet or just another OpenNMS instance.

== Files and Folder structure


It is recommended to extract the tar.gz content to `/opt/opennms-pris`.
The examples and the documentation are built based on this file structure.
It is possible to install _PRIS_ in a different directory, but you have to take care about adapting the paths in this documentation.

After extracting the archive the file structure should look like this:

----

<1> This documentation in HTML format; if you run _PRIS_ in HTTP mode you can access the documentation at http://<your-ip>:<port>/documentation
<2> Configuration examples for requisitions for every available source
<3> Default configuration for _PRIS_ to run in HTTP mode on port `8000`
<4> Libraries for the different sources which can be used with _PRIS_
<5> Start script to run _PRIS_ on a Windows
<6> Init script for old _System V_ systems running _PRIS_ in HTTP mode
<7> Main application file
<8> Systemd script to start _PRIS_ as background daemon, copy to `/etc/systemd/system/opennms-pris.service`
<9> Start script to run _PRIS_ on a Linux console in foreground
<10> Configuration directory for all requisitions to integrate inventories
<11> Default folder for scripts which are used in requisition configurations to manipulate the inventory import
<12> Drop-in for your custom created scripts
<13> Drop-in for default ready to use scripts

_PRIS_ needs at minimum two configuration files.
The first is called `global.properties`, and controls the general behavior of the provisioning integration server.
A requisition is just a directory in the application server directory `requisitions` and has to contain a file called `requisition.properties`.
The directory name is used to access the requisition.

You can create multiple requisitions using different sources, by creating a directory for each requisition with a `requisition.properties` inside.
The `global.properties`, the `requisitions` directory and the start script has to be in the same folder.
By default we suggest to install your _PRIS_ archive to `/opt/opennms-pris`.
If you want to provide the _OpenNMS_ requisitions via _HTTP_ from the built-in _Jetty_ web server as a background daemon, you can use the init scripts in the root directory of _PRIS_.
