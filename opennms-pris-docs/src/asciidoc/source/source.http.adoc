=== HTTP Source
This source is similar like the file source. Instead of reading from a local file, it can read a requisition via _HTTP_ from another _OpenNMS_.
The location for the requisition is given by OpenNMS provisioning ReST URL.
It is possible to provide a authentication to be able to consume the ReST service.
