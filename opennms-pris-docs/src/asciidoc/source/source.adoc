== Source

A Source is used to get the data to build an _OpenNMS requisition_.
Each requisition requires a `source` definition in the `requisition.properties` file.
Depending on the type of the source you have different configuration parameter.
An JDBC source for example has different configuration parameter than a XLS source.
The existing sources with the configuration are described in this section.
