=== File Driver
This driver offers the ability to generate an OpenNMS requisition directly into the filesystem.
To use the _file driver_ you have to set the parameters in the `global.properties`:

* `driver = file` method to generate the output
* `target = path/to/output/folder` for XML files to generate
* `requisition = *` _optional_: parameter as Java regexp filter for the requisition name
