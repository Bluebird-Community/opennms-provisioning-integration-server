=== File driver
This driver offers the ability to generate an OpenNMS requisition directly into the filesystem.
To use the _file driver_ you have to set the parameters in the `global.properties`:

* `driver` = `file` method to generate the output
* `target` = path for the output folder
* `requisition` = `*` optional parameter as Java regexp filter for the requisition name
