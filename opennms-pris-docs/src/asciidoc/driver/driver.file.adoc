=== File driver

This driver offers the ability to generate an OpenNMS requisition directly into the filesystem.
To use the `file driver` you have to set the parameters in the `global.properties`:

* `driver` = file
* `target` = /tmp/requisitions (the folder to store the requisition file)
* `requisitions` = * (optional: Java regexp filter for the requisitions to generate)
