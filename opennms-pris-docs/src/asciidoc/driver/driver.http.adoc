=== HTTP driver
The HTTP driver starts _PRIS_ as a web server to provide the OpenNMS requisition over HTTP.

* `driver` = `http` run as web server and provide requisitions over HTTP
* `host` = Network interface for listening, e.g. `*` = any, `127.0.0.1` = localhost ony
* `port` = `8000` TCP port to listen for incoming requests

Access to the requisition can be tested with a browser to URL http://<your-ip>:<port>8000/<name-requisition-cfg>.
The path _name-requisition-cfg_ is the folder name which runs the requisition configuration located in your _PRIS_ server directory.
