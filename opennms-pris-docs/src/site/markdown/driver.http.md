### HTTP driver
This driver starts up a web server and provides up-to-date requisitions on a http request base. This driver requires the following parameters in the `global.properties`:

* `driver` = http (points to this driver)
* `host` = 127.0.0.1 (the ip for the http-server)
* `port` = 8000 (the port used for the http-server)
