# OpenNMS Provisioning Integration Server
The provisioning integration server (_pris_) is a software which provides the ability to get external information from your inventory into an _OpenNMS_ requisition model. The output from _pris_ is provided as _XML_ over _HTTP_ and can be used in _OpenNMS Provisiond_ to import and discover nodes from. In _OpenNMS_ a requisition is set of nodes where you want to import network devices into _OpenNMS_. You can assign service detectors and policies to model the network monitoring behavior. For this reason a requisition should contain nodes which have a similar network monitoring profile. To make it easier to integrate external data sources the OpenNMS pris is introduced.

The service is used to provide an integration point for _OpenNMS_ external inventories or home brew inventories. With pris the data is normalized to the _OpenNMS_ requisition model and can be consumed from _OpenNMS provisiond_. It is highly specialized to enrich the requisition model with _SNMP_ information i.e. _SNMP_ interfaces, generic _SNMP_ attributes like system location, contact and the system description. Beside that _Provisiond_ can also run service detectors against IP interfaces and allows to run policies to control the monitoring behavior. _Pris_ is an instance in front of _Provisiond_, it allows to aggregate information from different sources and manipulate them in a flexible way.

_Pris_ needs at minimum two configuration files. First one is called `global.properties`, it controls the general behavior of the provisioning integration server. The second configuration file defines the requisition itself and is called `requisition.properties`. You can create multiple requisitions using different sources, by creating a directory for each requisition with a `requisition.properties` inside. The `global.properties` and the directories with your requisitions has to be in the same directory where the `java -jar opennms-pris.jar` command is called. By default we suggest to install your `opennms-pris.jar` to `/opt/opennms-pris`. If you want to provide the _OpenNMS_ requisitions via _HTTP_ from the build in _Jetty_ web server as background daemon, you can use the init script in `opennms-pris/src/examples/opennms-pris`.
